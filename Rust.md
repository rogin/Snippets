# Rust

## Intro items

[A great walkthrough](https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/error-handling-rust/) of error handling by the [Zero to Production in Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/) author.

This might be the most helpful intro book on Rust that I've read in terms of items like _Rc_ and examples using them - [Rust Standard Library Cookbook](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/programming/9781788623926/8/ch08lvl1sec50). Review its bookmarks.

Check out the [github star list](https://github.com/stars/rogin/lists/rust).

Check out your bookmarks in 'rust' folder. Perhaps integrate them here instead.

[A tour of Rust's standard library traits](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog/blob/master/posts/tour-of-rusts-standard-library-traits.md).

It's been at least a year since reading through the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)

[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) are small exercises.

From [Learn Rust the Dangerous Way](https://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/6/)

- Document the compiler version you tested with, or ideally, pin it in your build system. (Rust has the [rust-toolchain](https://docs.rs/rust-toolchain/latest/rust_toolchain/) file to do this.)
- Include a benchmark test that will indicate if things have suddenly gotten slower, so you can at least know to investigate. Ensure that this test runs as part of the build or continuous integration flow. (For Rust projects using Cargo, I recommend [Criterion](https://docs.rs/criterion/).)

A great deep dive into [unique access](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2019/02/07/rust-a-unique-perspective.html).
