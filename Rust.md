# Rust

## Getting started

Use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install the toolchain.

## Books

* The [Rust Standard Library Cookbook](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/programming/9781788623926/8/ch08lvl1sec50) might be the most helpful intro book that I've read in terms of items like _Rc_ and examples using them. Review its bookmarks.

## Optimizations

[Paraphrasing](https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/133wk4x/help_with_rust_program_performance/jid46k4/): _But if you need to squeeze every bit of speed out of it, add `lto = true` to your release profile in your `cargo.toml` to enable link time optimizations. It increases build times for your release builds, but I find it gives 10-20% better performance._

[More](https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/133wk4x/help_with_rust_program_performance/jibsyge/): `cargo run` will also build, so if you do `cargo build --release` followed by `cargo run` then it will run an __unoptimized__ build

From [Learn Rust the Dangerous Way](https://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/6/)

* Document the compiler version you tested with, or ideally, pin it in your build system. (Rust has the [rust-toolchain](https://docs.rs/rust-toolchain/latest/rust_toolchain/) file to do this.)
* Include a benchmark test that will indicate if things have suddenly gotten slower, so you can at least know to investigate. Ensure that this test runs as part of the build or continuous integration flow. (For Rust projects using Cargo, I recommend [Criterion](https://docs.rs/criterion/).)
