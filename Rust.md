# Rust

## Intro items

This might be the most helpful intro book on Rust that I've read in terms of items like _Rc_ and examples using them - [Rust Standard Library Cookbook](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/programming/9781788623926/8/ch08lvl1sec50). Review its bookmarks.

Check out the [github star list](https://github.com/stars/rogin/lists/rust).

Check out your bookmarks in 'rust' folder. Perhaps integrate them here instead.

It's been at least a year since reading through these [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)

[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) are small exercises.
